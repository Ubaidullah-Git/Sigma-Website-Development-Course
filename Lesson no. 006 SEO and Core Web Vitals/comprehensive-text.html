<!-- Core Web Vitals (CWVs) are crucial Google SEO ranking factors measuring user experience: loading (LCP), interactivity (INP), and visual stability (CLS). Optimizing these metrics—ensuring fast loading, quick responsiveness, and stable layouts—leads to better user engagement, lower bounce rates, and higher search rankings by signalling a quality page experience to Google.
The Three Core Web Vitals Metrics
Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): Measures loading performance; time for the largest image or text block to load.
Good: <= 2.5 seconds.
Interaction to Next Paint (INP): Measures responsiveness; time from user interaction (click/tap) to browser response (replaced FID in March 2024).
Good: <= 200 milliseconds.
Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Measures visual stability; unexpected shifts of page content.
Good: <= 0.1. 
Why They Matter for SEO
Ranking Signal: CWVs are part of Google's Page Experience signals, influencing search rankings alongside mobile-friendliness, HTTPS, and safe browsing.
User Experience: Faster, more stable, and responsive sites keep users longer, increasing conversions and reducing abandonment.
Real-World Data: Google uses field data (from real users via the Chrome User Experience Report) for rankings, assessing performance across device types (mobile/desktop). -->
